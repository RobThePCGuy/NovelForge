writing_guidelines: "\n    **Core Writing Instructions:**\n    - Genre: Contemporary\
  \ Fiction\n    - Setting: Remote mountain observatory\n    - Target Audience: Middle\
  \ Grade (MG) (8-12)\n    - Concept: Characters must navigate a perilous journey\
  \ through dangerous territory.\n    - Main Characters: Elara Meadowbrook: \"An Everyman:\
  \ a village baker who discovers a hidden map and is thrust into an unexpected adventure.\"\
  ; Mara Stone: \"A Caregiver: protects a group of orphans in a post-apocalyptic wasteland,\
  \ driven by compassion.\"\n    - Key World Element: Anarcho-Syndicalism (Society\
  \ organized through decentralized, voluntary worker collectives or syndicates.)\n\
  \    - Themes: Childhood Trauma / Nostalgia\n    - Tone: Fearful\n\n    **Chapter\
  \ Writing Requirements (Apply Continuously):**\n    - **Show, Don't Tell:** Demonstrate\
  \ emotions/states via actions, dialogue, internal thoughts, sensory details. Avoid\
  \ stating feelings directly.\n    - **Character Voice:** Reflect established voices/perspectives\
  \ consistently. Refer to core traits/motivations/flaws. Dialogue should sound distinct\
  \ for each character.\n    - **Sensory Details:** Ground scenes vividly in the setting\
  \ (Remote mountain observatory) using specific sight, sound, smell, touch, taste\
  \ details. Make them purposeful, contributing to mood or plot.\n    - **Pacing:**\
  \ Adjust sentence/paragraph length and detail level to control scene pace (e.g.,\
  \ Varied Pacing (shifting tempo for dynamics)). Vary pace strategically between\
  \ action and reflection. Avoid long stretches of uniform pace.\n    - **Consistency:**\
  \ Maintain strict continuity with characters (actions, knowledge, abilities), world\
  \ rules (Anarcho-Syndicalism), established plot events, setting details, and overall\
  \ tone (Fearful). Refer back to synopsis and notes.\n    - **Theme Resonance:**\
  \ Subtly weave in themes like 'Childhood Trauma / Nostalgia' through character choices,\
  \ conflicts, dialogue nuances, or symbolic imagery. Avoid explicit moralizing.\n\
  \    - **Avoid Info-Dumps:** Integrate necessary exposition organically through\
  \ dialogue arising from character need, actions revealing world aspects, or discoveries\
  \ within the scene. Do not pause the narrative for lengthy explanations.\n    -\
  \ **Avoid Deus Ex Machina:** Solutions to problems must feel earned and plausible\
  \ within the established world rules and character capabilities. Use foreshadowing\
  \ effectively. Foreshadow a consequence of the world element. Ensure character actions\
  \ have consequences.\n\n    **Specific Scene Requirements:**\n    - Scene Focus:\
  \ Each scene should have a clear purpose (advance plot, reveal character, introduce\
  \ conflict). Often include protagonist (Elara Meadowbrook) in action/situation like\
  \ negotiating with a rival. Ensure scenes start and end effectively (e.g., hook,\
  \ transition, mini-cliffhanger).\n    - Chapter Endings: Aim for strong hooks, turning\
  \ points, cliffhangers, significant revelations, or poignant emotional moments relevant\
  \ to the chapter goal and overall arc. Avoid flat or insignificant endings.\n  \
  \  - Climax (Overall): Must feature the highest stakes, direct confrontation of\
  \ the core conflict, peak emotional intensity, and a resolution (even if costly)\
  \ driven by protagonist action/choice. Should provide payoff for major plot threads.\n\
  \    - Post-Climax (Falling Action): Show the immediate consequences of the climax,\
  \ emotional/physical toll on characters, reflection on events, and the initial steps\
  \ towards establishing the 'new normal' or resolution.\n    - Ending (Resolution):\
  \ Provide clear payoff for main character arcs (transformation, acceptance, etc.).\
  \ Resolve the central conflict. Reflect conclusively on the primary themes. Show\
  \ the final state of the world/relationships affected by the story. Lingering questions\
  \ or sequel hooks are acceptable *if* appropriate for the genre and intended effect,\
  \ but the core story should feel complete.\n\n    **Refinement Checks (Editor/Writer/Consistency\
  \ Focus):**\n    - Pacing: Is it varied appropriately? If rushed, add internal thought/sensory\
  \ detail/beats. If slow, condense description/exposition, increase stakes, or inject\
  \ action/dialogue.\n    - Dialogue: Does it sound authentic to each character's\
  \ voice/background/mood? Does it reveal character/advance plot/contain subtext?\
  \ Eliminate generic or purely expositional dialogue.\n    - Description: Is it specific,\
  \ concrete, and sensory? Does it contribute to tone/atmosphere/worldbuilding? Replace\
  \ vague adjectives/adverbs with stronger verbs/nouns and specific details relevant\
  \ to Remote mountain observatory.\n    - Plot Points: Are motivations clear? Are\
  \ consequences shown? Are stakes high enough? If underdeveloped, expand on character\
  \ reactions, decision-making processes, and the ripple effects of events.\n    -\
  \ Conflict/Resolution: Is conflict compelling and plausible? Is resolution earned,\
  \ avoiding easy fixes or deus ex machina? Introduce meaningful complications (e.g.,\
  \ A rival actively works to sabotage the protagonist's goal) if conflict feels weak.\
  \ Ensure obstacle resolution aligns with character skills/world rules.\n    - Exposition:\
  \ Is background info integrated smoothly or dumped? Rewrite info-dumps to be revealed\
  \ through character experience, dialogue driven by need-to-know, or environmental\
  \ storytelling.\n    - Tropes: Are tropes used consciously? Rework clich\xE9s into\
  \ unique versions fitting the specific world/characters, or subvert them intentionally.\n\
  \    - Consistency Errors: Check names, timeline, established facts, character knowledge/abilities\
  \ against previous chapters/notes/synopsis. Flag any contradictions.\n    "
